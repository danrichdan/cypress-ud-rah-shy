# cypress-ud-rah-shy
This is a repo with the tests from a tutorial by rahul shetty on cypress test automation, so that I may have it on multiple devices.
It contains multiple tests as examples.
Some of the tests were changed a little.
Highly recommend getting the course from Udemy, he goes into much more detail and is worth going through.
This has helped me create a test framework with cypress in my day job.
